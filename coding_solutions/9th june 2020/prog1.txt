Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

list1 = [11, 22, 5, 46, 67, 92, 1]
 
even_count, odd_count = 0, 0

for num in list1:
 
    if num % 2 == 0:
 
        even_count += 1

    else:
 
        odd_count += 1


print("Even numbers in the list: ", even_count) 

print("Odd numbers in the list: ", odd_count)
